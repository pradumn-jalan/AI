# Hidden Markov Model , Viterbi Algorithm
The aim here is to deduce the tags, words, transition probabilities, emission probabilities, and prior probabilities using some training data and then use these to predict POS tags using Viterbi's Algorithm.

# Linear Regression
Basic Linear Regression with any number of features support. Gradient Descent Algorithm is used for training the model. More details under the sub-folder.

# and Logistic Regression
Basic Logistic Regression with any number of features support. Gradient Descent Algorithm is used for training the model. More details under the sub-folder. 

# Proposition Logic
Some functions for evaluating PL expressions. Currently, support exists for five basic operators: NOT, OR, AND, ->, and <->.
